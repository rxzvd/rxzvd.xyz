# Hello! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/otdpOnl.gif" width="30px">

I made rxzvd.xyz as a Portfolio/About Me for Myself. I decided to also put The Source Code on Github incase others wanted to peak at The Code (instead of doing view-source:https://rxzvd.xyz/) and Incase others want to use it, but You can't just nab it all for yourself <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/801059559573553162.png?v=1" style="height: 32px;"> (give me sm credit pls n ty)
