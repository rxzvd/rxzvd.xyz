# Hello! <img src="https://i.imgur.com/otdpOnl.gif" width="30px">

I made rxzvd.xyz as a Portfolio/About Me for Myself. I decided to also put The Source Code on Github incase others wanted to peak at The Code (instead of doing view-source:https://rxzvd.xyz/) and Incase others want to use it, but You can't just nab it all for yourself <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/801059559573553162.png?v=1" style="height: 32px;"> (More updates soon!)

# **Installation**

```
-> git clone https://github.com/rxzvd/rxzvd.xyz
-> Open Visual Studio Code/Any editor of Your Choice
-> Edit code to Your Liking
-> make sure my gun is in there
-> done???
```

# **Credits**

You don't really **HAVE** to give me credits, I'd just prefer it. Literally even commenting in The Code "Made by rxzvd" or something. Thank you <3
